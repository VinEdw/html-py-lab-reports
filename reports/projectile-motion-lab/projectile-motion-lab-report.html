      <strong>Objective</strong>
      <br>
      The goal of this lab was to verify the kinematic equations for projectile motion (free fall), specifically in the case where a projectile is launched horizontally at some height above the ground.

      <h2>Theory</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        The projectiles used in this lab, steel ball bearings, were modeled as point particles falling under the influence of gravity alone, with air resistance considered negligible.
        Thus, they were expected to move with constant horizontal velocity and constant downward acceleration.
        In addition, since they were projected horizontally off of a flat table, they would have zero initial velocity component in the vertical direction.
        A coordinate system was chosen with the ball starting its fall at $x=0$, the positive x-axis in the ball's horizontal direction of motion, the ground at $y=0$, and the positive y-axis pointed up.
        Applying the kinematic equations for constant acceleration yields the following equations for the motion of the ball:
      </p>
      <p>
        $$x=v_0t \tag{1}$$
        describes the ball's horizontal position over time where $x$ is the horizontal position, $v_0$ is the initial speed, and $t$ is the amount of time that has passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$y=y_0 - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \tag{2}$$
        describes the ball's vertical position over time where $y$ is the vertical position, $y_0$ is the initial height above the ground, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$v_x = v_0 \tag{3}$$
        describes the ball's horizontal velocity over time where $v_x$ is the horizontal velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$v_y = -gt \tag{4}$$
        describes the ball's vertical velocity over time where $v_y$ is the vertical velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$y = y_0 - \dfrac{gx^2}{2v_0^2} \tag{5}$$
        describes the ball's path through the air, and is the result of substituting equation 1 into equation 2 and eliminating $t$.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        In Part 2, the ball is launched onto an angled board (see the diagram in the Method section for more details).
        The position of the board in this coordinate system can be described by the following equation:
        $$y=y_0 - \tan(\theta) x \tag{6}$$
        where $\theta$ is the angle of the board above horizontal.
        Solving for the intersection between the board and the path of the ball yields
        $$x = \dfrac{2v_0^2\tan(\theta)}{g} \tag{7}$$
        where $x$ is the horizontal position of the collision between the ball and the board.
        Applying some trigonometry to this expression yields
        $$d = \dfrac{2v_0^2\tan(\theta)}{g\cos(\theta)} \tag{8}$$
        where $d$ is the distance along the angled board from the top where the ball collided with the board.

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <h3>Part 1</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        See Figure 1 for a diagram of the setup used in Part 1.
        Two wood blocks, each with a groove in the top center, were placed onto the table.
        A metal v-channel was placed on top of the wood blocks and into the grooves.
        The v-channel would serve as a track for the ball.
        Care was taken to make sure the v-channel was horizontal and level, with its end aligned with the edge of the table.
        The height of the v-channel above the floor ($y_0$) was measured using a meter stick in order to set the scale of the video recording.
        Next, a cell phone camera was set up to record the motion of the ball.
        A regular, real-time recording was used (no slow motion).
        Care was taken to make sure the cell phone ran parallel to the ball's plane of motion (in other words, the camera's line of sight was perpendicular to the plane of the ball's motion).
        This was done so that distances between points in the video would not be shortened due to an angled perspective.
        Once everything was set up, a steel ball bearing was rolled off the v-channel and onto the floor, with the camera recording the motion.
        This last step was repeated for two runs, making sure to get two clear recordings of the full motion of the ball at two noticeably different initial speeds.
        The recordings would later be analyzed using Logger Pro to get position data of the ball over time.

      <h3>Part 2</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        See Figure 2 for a diagram of the setup used in Part 2.
        Two wood blocks, each with a groove in the top center, were placed onto the table.
        A metal v-channel was placed on top of the wood blocks and into the grooves.
        Care was taken to make sure the v-channel was horizontal and level, with its end aligned with the edge of the table.
        A second v-channel was set up angled into the first.
        This second v-channel had its end secured by a clamp attached to a ring stand.
        A ball would be able to roll down the angled v-channel, into the horizontal v-channel, then off the table.
        For each trial, the steel ball bearing was released from the same spot on the angled v-channel.
        A small piece of tape was used to help mark the release position used.
        The height of the v-channel above the floor ($y_0$) was measured using a meter stick.
        Next, a pilot launch was done to get a sense of the region the ball would land on the floor.
        A white piece of paper was taped to the floor in that region with a sheet of carbon paper placed on top.
        The ball was then released from the starting position for five trials, measuring the distance between the point of collision with the floor and the base of the table ($R$) for each trial.
        The measurements of $y_0$ and $R$ would be used to calculate the theoretical initial speed of the ball ($v_0$).
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        For the next portion, a wooden board was placed against the table with its upper end just below the v-channel.
        A magnetic angle locator was used to measure the angle of the board ($\theta$).
        A pilot launch was done to get a sense of the region the ball would land on the board.
        A white piece of paper was taped to the board in that region with a sheet of carbon paper held on top.
        The ball was then released from the starting position for ten trials, measuring the distance between the point of collision with the board and the upper end of the board ($d$) for each trial.
        The average value for $d$ would later be compared with the predicted value found using $\theta$ and $v_0$ (which was calculated using $y_0$ and $R$)
