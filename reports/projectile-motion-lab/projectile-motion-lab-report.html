      <strong>Objective</strong>
      <br>
      The goal of this lab was to verify the kinematic equations for projectile motion (free fall), specifically in the case where a projectile is launched horizontally at some height above the ground.

      <h2>Theory</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        The projectiles used in this lab, steel ball bearings, were modeled as point particles falling under the influence of gravity alone, with air resistance considered negligible.
        Thus, they were expected to move with constant horizontal velocity and constant downward acceleration.
        In addition, since they were projected horizontally off of a flat table, they would have zero initial velocity component in the vertical direction.
        A coordinate system was chosen with the ball starting its fall at $x=0$, the positive x-axis in the ball's horizontal direction of motion, the ground at $y=0$, and the positive y-axis pointed up.
        Applying the kinematic equations for constant acceleration yields the following equations for the motion of the ball:
      </p>
      <p>
        $$x=v_0t \tag{1}$$
        describes the ball's horizontal position over time where $x$ is the horizontal position, $v_0$ is the initial speed, and $t$ is the amount of time that has passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$y=y_0 - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \tag{2}$$
        describes the ball's vertical position over time where $y$ is the vertical position, $y_0$ is the initial height above the ground, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$v_x = v_0 \tag{3}$$
        describes the ball's horizontal velocity over time where $v_x$ is the horizontal velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$v_y = -gt \tag{4}$$
        describes the ball's vertical velocity over time where $v_y$ is the vertical velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        $$y = y_0 - \dfrac{gx^2}{2v_0^2} \tag{5}$$
        describes the ball's path through the air, and is the result of substituting equation 1 into equation 2 and eliminating $t$.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        In Part 2, the ball is launched onto an angled board (see the diagram in the Method section for more details).
        The position of the board in this coordinate system can be described by the following equation:
        $$y=y_0 - \tan(\theta) x \tag{6}$$
        where $\theta$ is the angle of the board above horizontal.
        Solving for the intersection between the board and the path of the ball yields
        $$x = \dfrac{2v_0^2\tan(\theta)}{g} \tag{7}$$
        where $x$ is the horizontal position of the collision between the ball and the board.
        Applying some trigonometry to this expression yields
        $$d = \dfrac{2v_0^2\tan(\theta)}{g\cos(\theta)} \tag{8}$$
        where $d$ is the distance along the angled board from the top where the ball collided with the board.

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <h3>Part 1</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        See Figure 1 for a diagram of the setup used in Part 1.
        Two wood blocks, each with a groove in the top center, were placed onto the table.
        A metal v-channel was placed on top of the wood blocks and into the grooves.
        The v-channel would serve as a track for the ball.
        Care was taken to make sure the v-channel was horizontal and level, with its end aligned with the edge of the table.
        The height of the v-channel above the floor ($y_0$) was measured using a meter stick in order to set the scale of the video recording.
        Next, a cell phone camera was set up to record the motion of the ball.
        A regular, real-time recording was used (no slow motion).
        Care was taken to make sure the cell phone ran parallel to the ball's plane of motion (in other words, the camera's line of sight was perpendicular to the plane of the ball's motion).
        This was done so that distances between points in the video would not be shortened due to an angled perspective.
        Once everything was set up, a steel ball bearing was rolled off the v-channel and onto the floor, with the camera recording the motion.
        This last step was repeated for two runs, making sure to get two clear recordings of the full motion of the ball at two noticeably different initial speeds.
        The recordings would later be analyzed using Logger Pro to get position data of the ball over time.

      <h3>Part 2</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        See Figure 2 for a diagram of the setup used in Part 2.
        Two wood blocks, each with a groove in the top center, were placed onto the table.
        A metal v-channel was placed on top of the wood blocks and into the grooves.
        Care was taken to make sure the v-channel was horizontal and level, with its end aligned with the edge of the table.
        A second v-channel was set up angled into the first.
        This second v-channel had its end secured by a clamp attached to a ring stand.
        A ball would be able to roll down the angled v-channel, into the horizontal v-channel, then off the table.
        For each trial, the steel ball bearing was released from the same spot on the angled v-channel.
        A small piece of tape was used to help mark the release position used.
        The height of the v-channel above the floor ($y_0$) was measured using a meter stick.
        Next, a pilot launch was done to get a sense of the region the ball would land on the floor.
        A white piece of paper was taped to the floor in that region with a sheet of carbon paper placed on top.
        The ball was then released from the starting position for five trials, measuring the distance between the point of collision with the floor and the base of the table ($R$) for each trial.
        The measurements of $y_0$ and $R$ would be used to calculate the theoretical initial speed of the ball ($v_0$).
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        For the next portion, a wooden board was placed against the table with its upper end just below the v-channel.
        A magnetic angle locator was used to measure the angle of the board ($\theta$).
        A pilot launch was done to get a sense of the region the ball would land on the board.
        A white piece of paper was taped to the board in that region with a sheet of carbon paper held on top.
        The ball was then released from the starting position for ten trials, measuring the distance between the point of collision with the board and the upper end of the board ($d$) for each trial.
        The average value for $d$ would later be compared with the predicted value found using $\theta$ and $v_0$ (which was calculated using $y_0$ and $R$)

        The prior data was gathered by using the video analysis tool in Logger Pro on the recording of the first run (the run with the slower starting speed out of the two runs).
        The scale was set using the measured value for $y_0$ ($88.4 \pm 0.2 \units{cm}$).
        The axes were shifted such that the ball started at $x=0$ and landed at $y=0$.
        14 data points (frames) were captured.

        The prior data was gathered by using the video analysis tool in Logger Pro on the recording of the second run (the run with the higher starting speed out of the two runs).
        The scale was set using the measured value for $y_0$ ($88.4 \pm 0.2 \units{cm}$).
        The axes were shifted such that the ball started at $x=0$ and landed at $y=0$.
        13 data points (frames) were captured.

        The prior table summarizes some of the motion data from Part 1 for Runs 1 and 2.
        It includes the initial and final velocity components of the ball, values which were simply read from Table 1.
        It also includes the initial and final speeds of the ball, found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the velocity components.
        Towards the bottom, it includes a value for $R$, the horizontal distance traveled by the ball.
        This was found by taking the difference between the initial and final $x$ positions.
        Next, it includes a value for $t$, the time the ball was traveling through the air.
        This was found by taking the difference between the initial and final time values.
        The uncertainty was taken to be plus or minus the duration of one frame, about 0.03 seconds.
        Lastly, it includes the vertical acceleration of the ball.
        This was found by doubling the coefficient for $t^2$ in the curve fit equations for vertical position versus time (in accord with equation 2).

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      
      <h3>Part 1</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        In Part 1, a steel ball bearing was recorded rolling horizontally off of a table and onto the ground.
        This was done for two runs in which the ball had a noticeably different starting speed.
        Comparing the data between the two runs seems to support certain qualities of the motion of projectiles projected horizontally.
        To start, equation 1 suggests that the horizontal distance traveled by the ball is proportional to the initial horizontal velocity.
        Looking at the $v_{0x}$ and $R$ data in table 3, the ball in Run 2 had about double the initial horizontal velocity of Run 1 ($(1.115 \units{m/s})/(0.582 \units{m/s}) = 1.9 \approx 2$), and subsequently traveled about double the horizontal distance ($(0.4217 \units{m})/(0.2732 \units{m}) = 1.5 \approx 2$).
        Thus, the data seems to support this property described by equation 1.
        Next, equation 2 suggests that the time to reach the ground is independent of initial velocity.
        Despite both runs having noticeably different initial velocities, both took about the same amount of time to reach the ground (0.43 ± 0.03 s for Run 1, and 0.40 ± 0.03 s for Run 2; values from table 3).
        Since these time values lie within each other's uncertainty, the data is consistent with the notion that projectiles launched horizontally should take the same amount of time to reach the ground, regardless of initial velocity.
        Lastly, equation 2 suggests that the acceleration of the ball in the air is independent of initial velocity.
        Despite both runs having noticeably different initial velocities, both had about the same vertical acceleration (-8.6 ± 0.3 m/s^2 for Run 1, and -8.7 ± 0.3 m/s^2 for Run 2; values from table 3).
        Since these acceleration values lie within each other's uncertainty, the data is consistent with the notion that projectiles launched horizontally should have the same acceleration, regardless of initial velocity.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        However, it should be noted that the acceleration values in both runs, while consistent with each other, are not consistent with the accepted value of 9.81 m/s^2.
        It is possible that the recording was not aligned perpendicular to the ball's plane of motion, as was intended.
        Since the cell phone was help by a human and only estimated to be aligned properly, it would have been easy for the recording to have been done at a slightly slanted perspective.
        This would have reduced the measured distance values compared to their actual values, thereby reducing the calculated acceleration.
        In the future, this source of error might be mitigated by supporting the cell phone (or some other camera) on a stable stand with a level.
        This would allow the experimenters to ensure that the camera is aligned properly before recording the motion of the ball.
        Another potential cause of this are the effects of air resistance.
        Air resistance would have hindered the ball's motion, causing it to accelerate more slowly in the downward direction.
        This explanation would also be consistent with the slight downward trend seen in the horizontal velocity versus time graphs for both runs (figures 5 & 10).
        In the future, this source of error might be reduced by using a ball with a greater density.
        Its greater mass and lower cross-sectional area would make it less susceptible to the effects of air resistance.
        Alternatively, if the budget allows, the experiment might be performed in a vacuum chamber where there is very little air to impede the ball's motion.

      <h3>Part 2</h3>
      <p class="indent">
        In Part 2, a steel ball bearing was rolled horizontally off of a table and onto an angled wooden board.
        Before this though, the ball was rolled off the table and onto the ground so that the initial speed of the ball might be determined.
        With that calculated initial velocity, where the ball would land on the angled board could be predicted.
        From table 6, the ball was predicted to land at $d=92 \pm 3 \units{cm}$, but it was measured to land on average at $d=87.17 \pm 0.06 \units{cm}$ (see figure 2 for what distance $d$ represents).
        The difference between these values is $D = 5 \pm 3 \units{cm}$ (value from table 6).
        Since this difference does not include the value zero, the values are not consistent.
        In other words, the measured value for $d$ does not agree with the predicted value.
        While it might at first seem that the kinematic equations described at the outset are inaccurate, it is more likely that some other factors are at play.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        One source of error likely comes from the effects of air resistance. 
        Air resistance would have impeded the motion of the ball, preventing it from traveling the full distance predicted.
        In the future, this source of error might be reduced by using a ball with a greater density.
        Its greater mass and lower cross-sectional area would make it less susceptible to the effects of air resistance.
        Alternatively, if the budget allows, the experiment might be performed in a vacuum chamber where there is very little air to impede the ball's motion.
        Another potential source of error comes from the fact that the board might have changed angle over the course of the experiment.
        The board was not very well secured; normal force and friction between the board and the ground, a contact force between the board and the table, and its weight were all that kept it in place.
        It is possible that repeated collisions between the ball and board, along with measurements of $d$ with the meter stick pressed against the board, might have caused the board to slip and $\theta$ to decrease, unbeknownst to the experimenters. 
        Increasing the uncertainty of $\theta$ from 0.5° to 1° increases the uncertainty of $d_p$ from 3 cm to 5 cm, and thereby the uncertainty of $D$ from 3 cm to 5 cm.
        This adjustment in the uncertainty would make the predicted and measured values for $d$ compatible.
        Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the initial approximation for the uncertainty of $\theta$ (0.5°, half the smallest increment), was too low and that 1.0° is a more realistic value for the uncertainty.
