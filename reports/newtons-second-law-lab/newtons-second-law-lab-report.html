      <strong>Objective</strong>
      <br>
      The goal of this experiment is to verify Newton's second law of motion, specifically the aspect which states the acceleration of a system is proportional to the net force acting on the system.
    </p>

      <h2>Theory</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        Newton's second law can take the following equation form, where $\Sigma \vec F$ is the vector sum of the forces acting on a system, commonly referred to as $\vec F{net}$, and $\vec a$ is the acceleration of the system.
        $$\Sigma \vec F = m \vec a \tag{1}$$
        This implies that the magnitude of the acceleration of a system is proportional to the magnitude of the net force on the system.
        Creating a free body diagram (FBD) for the system examined in this experiment (hanging mass + cart) and applying Newton's second law to it yields the following expression for acceleration (assuming negligible friction) where $a$ is the acceleration of the system, $m_h$ is the hanging mass (plus any slotted masses attached), and $M_c$ is the mass of the cart (plus any slotted masses attached)
        $$a = \dfrac{m_h g}{M_c + m_h} \tag{2}$$
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        If it were instead assumed that there were some kind of constant frictional force ($f$) acting opposite the motion of the cart, then the expression for the acceleration of the system while the hanging mass is moving up ($a_{up}$) becomes
        $$a_{up} = \dfrac{m_h g + f}{M_c + m_h} \tag{3}$$
        and the expression for the acceleration of the system while the hanging mass is moving down ($a_{down}$) becomes
        $$a_{down} = \dfrac{m_h g - f}{M_c + m_h} \tag{4}$$
        both directed down for the hanging mass and towards the pulley for the cart. 
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Interestingly, it can be shown algebraically that the average ($a_{avg}$) of the two accelerations, $a_{up}$ and $a_{down}$, equals the acceleration ($a$) found by assuming there was no friction.
        In equation form, this relationship looks like the following.
        $$a = a_{avg} = \frac{1}{2} (a_{up} + a_{down}) \tag{5}$$
        Thus, by using $a_{avg}$ for the analysis instead of just $a_{up}$ or $a_{down}$, the impact of friction can be negated and the system can be examined as if there were negligible friction.

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        See Figure 1 for a diagram of the setup used.
        A motion encoder track was set on the table.
        Care was taken to make sure the track was level so that tension in the string would be the only unbalanced force acting on the cart.
        A motion encoder receiver was attached to one end of the track and connected through a LabQuest Mini to a computer.
        This would allow the cart's motion data to be recorded and analyzed at multiple points in the experiment.
        At the opposite end of the track a pulley was attached with a bumper just before it to prevent the cart from colliding with the pulley.
        5 slotted masses, each with a mass of 5 g, were attached to the cart with a piece of tape.
        The tape was used to secure the slotted masses on the cart and prevent them from moving, which could have impacted the measured acceleration.
        A string was also tied to the cart and connected to a 5 g mass hanger.
        The total mass of this system of objects was measured using a balance.
        The cart was then returned to the track with the string running over the pulley and the hanger going off the edge of the table.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        For each trial, the cart was given a slight, quick nudge in the direction away from the pulley with the motion encoder set to record this motion.
        The graph of velocity versus time produced was linear fit for a section where the cart was moving away from the pulley, the slope corresponding to $a_{up}$, followed by a linear fit for a section where the cart was moving towards the pulley, the slope corresponding to $a_{down}$.
        Care was taken to not include in the linear fit the time of the human push nor the time of the collision with the bumper, as the forces involved in those interactions would have undesirably impacted the acceleration.
        Between trials, a slotted mass was transferred from the cart to the mass hanger for a total of 5 trials.
        This kept the system mass constant while increasing the hanging mass.

        The prior table contains the data gathered in the five trials of the experiment.
        It contains the hanging mass ($m_h$), the acceleration when the hanger was moving up ($a_{up}$), the acceleration when the hanger was moving down ($a_{down}$), and the average of $a_{up}$ and $a_{down}$ ($a_{avg}$).
        Note that for each trial the system mass was kept constant.
        The uncertainty of the system mass ($m_{sys}$) was approximated to be due to read error (± half the smallest digit) and calibration error (± 0.05% of the measured value).

        The prior figure plots the average acceleration of the cart ($a_{avg}$) versus the hanging mass ($m_h$).
        In accord with equation 2, the plot was given a linear fit.
        The resulting equation was as follows, with uncertainty taken to be the standard error of the fit parameters.
        $$a_{avg} = (0.02523 \pm 0.00006 \units{\dfrac{m}{s^2 g}}) m_h + (0.0010 \pm 0.0009 \units{\dfrac{m}{s^2}}) \tag{6}$$

        The prior table contains information useful for a comparison of the slopes for a graph of acceleration versus hanging mass.
        $s_e$ came from the experimentally determined slope in equation 6.
        $s_t$ came from the theoretical slope suggested by equation 2, with uncertainty due to uncertainty in the system mass.
        $D$ is the difference between these two values, with uncertainty equal to the uncertainty of the two slopes added in quadrature.
        Notice that the difference $D$ does not include the value zero.
